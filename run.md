#### Installation on Windows
1. Download the archive "Croco game Windows.zip". Your browser may warn you that the file is potentially dangerous. Select the "Download anyway" option.
1. Unpack the archive. Just double-click on it, and it will open like a folder. Inside, there is only one folder named "Croco game". You can copy and paste it anywhere convenient on your computer.
    * If desired, you can create a shortcut on the desktop for easy game launching from there.
1. Go to the folder, double-click on the "Croco game.exe" file with the little crocodile icon. You will likely receive a warning about an unknown developer, potentially dangerous file, etc. Click "More info" and "Run anyway".
1. Enjoy the game.

#### Installation on MacOS
1. Download the archive "Croco game MacOS.zip". Your browser may warn you that the file is potentially dangerous. Select the "Download anyway" option.
1. Unpack the archive. Just double-click on it, and the unpacking will start, a "Croco game.app" file with a little crocodile will appear next to it. This file needs to be copied to the "Applications" folder (it won't launch from other folders).
1. Go to the "Applications" folder, find the freshly copied file, click on it while holding the Ctrl key, a context menu will open, in which select "Open". You will likely receive a warning about an unknown developer, potentially dangerous file, etc. Click "Run anyway". This operation needs to be performed only once, after that, the game can be launched as usual by clicking on the icon, also from the applications panel.
1. On some Macs, the game launches in a minimized window. That means if, a few seconds after launching, the icon with the crocodile appears at the bottom in the dock, but the game window itself doesn't, you need to click on the icon again.
1. Enjoy the game.
